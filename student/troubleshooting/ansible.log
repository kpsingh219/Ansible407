2018-06-14 13:53:32,872 p=5961 u=student |  ERROR! Syntax Error while loading YAML.


The error appears to have been in '/home/student/troubleshooting/samba.yml': line 8, column 30, but may
be elsewhere in the file depending on the exact syntax problem.

The offending line appears to be:

    install_state: installed
    random_var: This is colon: test
                             ^ here
